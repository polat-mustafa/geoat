          Chuck Norris once ordered a steak in a restaurant. The steak did what
          it was told. Chuck Norris invented airplanes because he was tired of
          being the only person that could fly. The only time Chuck Norris was
          ever wrong was when he thought he had made a mistake. Chuck Norris can
          dribble a bowling ball. Chuck Norris does not sleep. He waits.
